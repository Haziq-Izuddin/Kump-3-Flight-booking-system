In today’s highly competitive travel industry, the online flight booking system is a essential tool for facilitating flight-related operations.	This system was chosen as the target for this assignment in order to invoke system thinking and logical problem solving which are critical for this course.	Historically, booking a flight necessitated the painstaking manual efforts of travel agents or direct visits to airline offices, a method that was not only laborious but also prone to inefficiencies and human errors. The journey to develop a web-based service that would automate data transmission and storage, as well as facilitate real-time interaction between airlines and passengers during flights, required some time. 

The system’s primary objective is to ensure an effortless interaction between the users and the airline by assisting them in searching and booking airline tickets. By replacing manual record-keeping with computerized databases, the system ensures that passenger details and flight schedules are accurately stored and easily retrieved. The system enables customers to book flights remotely without the need to visit the airline offices. It also allows airline administrators to organize and manage available resources efficiently. Therefore, the system seeks to refine the operational efficiency of service providers in the aviation industry. 

Within this setup, two primary categories of users interact with the system: the travelers (end-users) and the airline administrators (back-end users). Travelers use the front-end interface to compare prices and check availability, while administrators access the back-end system to oversee schedule updates. In accordance with the project guidelines, the following sections of this report will examine this system (after breaking it down into its functional components) and display the logic in flowcharts and pseudocode
